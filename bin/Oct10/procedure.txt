Top down programming is a style of design where you create functions
as modules that are repeated and work together to work as a program
overall. These modules may be designed for specific purposes but
accept parameters and so can be reused in different parts of
the program. By splitting the project into smaller parts different
people can work on different element simultaneously.
Each module/function can also be tested individually, without running
the whole program.
This is compared to bottom up programming where low level utilities
are combined to create a high level program.
