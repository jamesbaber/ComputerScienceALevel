Top down programming is a style of design where you create functions
as modules that are repeated and work together to work as a program
overall. These modules may be designed for specific purposes but
accept parameters and so can be reused in different parts of
the program.
This is compared to bottom up programming where low level utilities
are combined to create a high level program.
